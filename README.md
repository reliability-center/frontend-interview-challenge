## Frontend Interview Challenge Template

Develop an application that supports creating, deleting, and listing todos. When submitting a new todo, the UI should update immediately. Pending network requests should be communicated with some kind of indicator. Using something like [`JSON Server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is acceptable. At the very least you should have typings defined for your `Todo` objectsâ€“typing responses/requests/errors will earn extra points.

Create your own repository using this template to begin and assign the Reliability point of contact as a collaborator once you're ready for us to review your work. :muscle:
